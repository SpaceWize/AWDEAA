 * A short clip whose playhead is driven by scroll position rather than by
 * playback — the footage advances as the section travels through the viewport
 * and stops when the reader stops.
 *
 * Smoothness comes from three things, and dropping any one brings back the
 * stutter:
 *
 *  1. The scroll listener only sets a flag. All reading and seeking happens in
 *     one requestAnimationFrame loop, at most once per displayed frame, and
 *     layout is measured on resize rather than every frame.
 *  2. The playhead eases toward the scroll position instead of snapping to it.
 *     Raw scroll input is jittery; following it exactly reproduces the jitter.
 *  3. Scrubbing waits for the clip to be fully buffered. Seeking into a
 *     partly-downloaded file turns every seek into a range request, which is
 *     precisely the stutter this is meant to avoid.
 *
 * For accessibility:
 *  - Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the clip is never even fetched. The poster
 *    carries the section, so those readers get a photograph and none of the
 *    bytes.
 *  - The wrapper carries role="img" with descriptive alt text and the <video>
 *    is hidden from the accessibility tree, so a screen reader announces one
 *    image rather than a media player it cannot operate.
 *  - Nothing auto-plays. Motion only happens while the reader is scrolling,
 *    so WCAG 2.2.2 does not apply.
